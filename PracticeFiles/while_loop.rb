# The next keyword can be used to skip over certain steps in the loop. For instance, if we donâ€™t want to print out the even numbers, we can write:

for a in 1..5
  next if a % 2 == 0
  print a
end

    # In the above example, we loop through the range of 1 through 5, assigning each number to i in turn.
    # If the remainder of i / 2 is zero, we go to the next iteration of the loop.
    # Then we print the value of i. This line only prints out 1, 3, and 5 because of the previous line.
