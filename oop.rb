###Object Orientating Programming OOP

## Everything in Ruby is an Object
## Two parts: OOP = Data & Behavior

# Objects are used to store data (state)
# Methods are used to run behavior

'james' # => is a data String

# What can be done to the data 'james' ?
'james'.capitalize # => behavior
'james'.upcase # => behavior
'james'.downcase # => behavior
'james'.length # => behavior

# these Methods classes are defined explicitly.
